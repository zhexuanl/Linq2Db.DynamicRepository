Abstract LINQ to DB with Repository Pattern

Clean separation of data access via IRepository<TEntity> and Linq2DbRepository<TEntity>.

Support for Reusable, Composable Querying

Support dynamic filtering, sorting, pagination, and grouping without repeated code.

Provide Dynamic Querying API

Allow flexible query creation using predicates, group by, order by, etc.

Build a Production-Ready, NuGet-Style Project

Clear structure, reusable components, extensible for real-world applications.

Support Async Methods

Ensure that all operations (querying, CRUD) are async and performant.

Prepare for Advanced Use Cases

Include raw SQL or SqlKata-style query support for complex needs.

âœ… What We Have Achieved
Feature / Module	Status	Notes
IRepository<TEntity> interface	âœ… Done	With core methods (GetById, FindAsync, QueryAsync, Insert/Update/Delete).
Linq2DbRepository<TEntity> implementation	âœ… Done	Fully implemented with filters, group by, paging, order by.
QueryOptions class	âœ… Done	For dynamic filtering (predicate), ordering, grouping, and paging.
QueryWrapper<TEntity> fluent helper	âœ… Done	Fluent way to build QueryOptions. Similar to QueryWrapper in MyBatis Plus.
Paged result wrapper	âœ… Done	Returns result list, page number, size, total count.
Async support for all methods	âœ… Done	All queries and commands are async.
Extension: FromSqlKata() support	âœ… Done	For raw query execution with SqlKata if needed.
Grouping support	âœ… Done	Via GroupBy in QueryOptions.
Bulk operations	âœ… Done	InsertBulkAsync() uses BulkCopyAsync.

ðŸ”œ Next Possible Enhancements (Optional)
Future Add-on	Description
Caching Layer (e.g. Redis)	Add caching to reduce DB pressure.
Soft Delete Support	Add IsDeleted and exclude in queries.
Auditing	Track created/modified timestamps.
Specification Pattern Integration	For richer domain-driven querying.
QueryBuilder/Specification DSL	Optional fluent DSL to build queries more declaratively.
Multi-tenancy support	Add filters for tenant isolation.
Multi-table joins	Add support for joining related tables in LINQ-to-DB.
Include navigation properties	Controlled eager/lazy loading.
